## 🛡️ Introduction

**Quresis** is the first application-layer security framework designed to operationalize Solana's emerging **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)** primitives via native SVM syscalls for the institutional market.

As Solana matures into the global execution layer for **Internet Capital Markets (ICM)**, trillions of dollars in long-duration assets—such as tokenized bonds, real estate, and equity—will be brought on-chain. These assets, with lifecycles spanning decades, are vulnerable to "Harvest Now, Decrypt Later" attacks by future quantum computers.

Quresis bridges the gap between raw protocol cryptography (ML-DSA) and developer usability. We provide the **"Quantum Guard"** via SPL-2022 Transfer Hooks, enabling asset issuers to mandate quantum-resistant signatures for high-value transactions without altering the core user experience.

## ⚡ Core Value Proposition

### 1. Native SVM Integration (Zero-Copy)
Instead of implementing heavy, custom cryptography in user space (which consumes excessive Compute Units), Quresis is architected to leverage Solana's upcoming **Native ML-DSA Syscalls** (such as those being pioneered by *Project Eleven*). This design ensures our protocol remains lightweight and aligned with the official Solana roadmap for quantum resistance.

### 2. The RWA Quantum Guard (SPL-2022)
We utilize **Token Extensions (Transfer Hooks)** to create a compliance layer for assets.
* **Small Tx (<$10k):** Standard Ed25519 signature (Fast, Low Friction).
* **Large Tx (>$10k):** Requires **Ed25519 + ML-DSA** Dual Signature.
* **Anti-Smurfing (Velocity Limits):** Prevents attackers from bypassing thresholds by aggregating transfer volumes over a 24-hour rolling window.

### 3. Drop-in Anchor Integration
Developers do not need to be cryptographers. Quresis exposes simple Anchor macros to secure Program Derived Addresses (PDAs) and Token Mints.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

Quresis acts as the orchestration layer between the Solana Runtime and User Programs.

### Key Features
- **Quantum Identity PDA**: Links Solana wallet with ML-DSA public key.
- **Velocity Tracking (Anti-Smurfing)**: Aggregates transfer amounts over 24-hour windows to prevent threshold circumvention.
- **Zero-Copy Parsing**: Reads states efficiently to minimize Compute Unit (CU) consumption.
- **Three Enforcement Modes**: Disabled, SoftEnforce, HardEnforce.

## 📦 TypeScript SDK

Install the SDK for off-chain ML-DSA key generation:

```bash
npm install @quresis/sdk
```

```typescript
import { QuresisKeyPair, QuresisSigner } from '@quresis/sdk';

// Generate ML-DSA-44 keypair (NIST Level 2)
const keypair = QuresisKeyPair.generate('ML-DSA-44');
console.log(`Public key: ${keypair.publicKey.length} bytes`); // 1312

// Sign a message
const signer = new QuresisSigner(keypair);
const message = new TextEncoder().encode('Transfer 1000 tokens');
const signature = await signer.sign(message);
console.log(`Signature: ${signature.bytes.length} bytes`); // 2420
```

See [SDK README](./sdk/README.md) for full documentation.
